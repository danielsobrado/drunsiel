## Gathering at the Inn

The Rusty Axe hunched at the edge of the village, its weathered timber walls. Varian ducked under the low lintel, Elric at his heels. Five other guards already clustered around a table near the hearth, nursing tankards.

*"Well lads, no goblins yet."* Varian shed his cloak, shaking off the mist. *"Maybe we'll get a quiet night."*

Elric snorted. *"Quiet. Right. And I'm the bloody emperor of Grukmar."*

Varian glanced at him sidelong. Though he'd made the remark lightly, he couldn't shake a cold thread of unease. He turned to the barkeep. *"Ale. Two."*

They squeezed onto the bench, knees and elbows jostling. The tavern air lay thick and stale, laced with sweat and sour beer. At the far end of the room, a grizzled minstrel coaxed a doleful tune from a battered lute. The music wove between the low murmur of conversation and the crackle of the fire.

Varian took a pull of ale, grimacing at the bitter taste. Across the table, Tormund leaned forward, voice low.

*"You lads hear about them goblins in the east? Near Stonehold?"*

Varian frowned. *"What about them?"*

*"Word is they made some kind of pact. With the bloody orcs of all things."*

## Sharing of Tales

*"Orcs?"* Elric looked up, wiping foam from his lip. *"What would goblins do with such beasts?"*

*"Blood magic, some say."* Tormund's eyes glittered in the firelight. *"Some kind of dark ritual. Bound 'em together, made 'em stronger."*

*"Come off it."* Brynn, a burly redhead, snorted into his tankard. *"Goblins can barely find their own arses with both hands. You expect me to believe they're suddenly making pacts and casting spells?"*

*"I'm just telling you what I heard."* Tormund spread his hands. *"Folk been disappearing from villages up there. Goblins raiding bolder than ever. Something's stirred them up, mark my words."*

Varian shifted uneasily. He'd heard rumors too.

*"There's more."* This from Elara, her voice soft but carrying. The others turned to look at her.

The single woman in their group, she'd proven herself twice over, with blade and bow. But she had an uncanny knack for ferreting out gossip and rumors. When Elara spoke, men listened.

*"They say the goblins have shamans now. Witches who can call up storms and blight crops with a word."* She glanced around the table, firelight dancing in her dark eyes. *"They say they sacrifice captives to their dark gods. Paint their altars with blood and deck their totems with skulls."*

Silence followed her words. Varian could almost feel the weight of the others' unease.

## Debate Over Truth and Myth

Brynn broke the hush with a forced laugh. *"Come on, you don't believe that rubbish, do you? It's just stories."*

*"Stories got to come from somewhere,"* Tormund muttered.

*"Aye, from drunken louts and hysterical women."* Brynn took a long swallow of ale. *"You can't put stock in every wild tale that comes down the road."*

*"But what about the captain's orders?"* Elric spoke up. *"Double watches, no one past the village bounds... He's not doing that over ghost stories."*

*"The captain's just being cautious,"* Brynn said, but there was a note of doubt in his voice.

Varian said nothing. He stared into the depths of his tankard, watching the play of firelight on the dark surface. The stories chased themselves around his mind.  

Old superstitions, he told himself firmly. No thinking man put stock in such tales.
