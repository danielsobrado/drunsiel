## The Outpost

Varian trudged up the muddy path to the outpost. Elric followed, yawning. Varian's hand strayed to the sword at his hip, thumb worrying the pommel. The girl's terrified face lingered behind his eyelids.

*"Did you sleep at all?"* Elric mumbled.

*"No. You?"*

*"Same."*

Silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken fears. They passed between the outpost's timber walls. A few soldiers milled about, faces haggard above purple-shadowed eyes. Varian exchanged nods with the sentries and headed for the captain's quarters.

Alden waited outside, leaning on his spear, fidgeting. His young face looked strained.

*"What's happened?"* Varian asked.

*"Riders. From the frontier villages."*

*"Goblins?"* Elric's voice rose.

Alden shrugged miserably. *"They're inside with the captain. That's all I know."*

Varian squared his shoulders and knocked once on the weathered door before pushing it open. Captain Aldric stood behind his desk, two men in mud-splattered cloaks before him.

*"...found three more dead cows,"* one was saying. *"Throats cut."*

Aldric glanced up, face carved from granite. *"Varian. Elric."* He gestured them forward.

*"Goblins?"* The word thudded in the close air.

*"So it would seem."* Aldric rubbed his grizzled chin. *"These men found goblin tracks near the bodies. But no sightings."*

*"They killed three cows?"* Elric asked.

*"Yes,"* the cloaked man said. *"But they didn't take them."*

An uneasy silence descended. Varian felt his pulse quicken. The girl's scream echoed in his memory. He stepped forward.

*"Sir, we had an incident in the village last night. A girl, attacked near the square."* He described her terror, the strange absence of any assailant when they investigated. As he spoke, he saw Aldric's face grow graver.

*"You found no tracks? No signs?"*

*"None, sir. But the girl was hysterical. She kept staring at the forest..."*

Aldric nodded slowly. He dismissed the cloaked men and then turned to Varian and Elric.

*"I'll not lie, lads. This bodes ill."* His eyes were shadowed. *"But we mustn't be hasty. **Panic is the enemy now**."*

*"What do we do?"* Elric asked.

The captain straightened. *"Double the watch. Patrol in pairs, never alone. I want a full sweep of our borders."*

*"We'll need more men,"* Varian said. *"The outpost is already stretched thin."*

*"I know. I'll draft some from the village. Elric, see to that."* Aldric fixed them with a stern look. *"But listen well - **no one ventures into Grukmar territory**. Understood? We watch, we guard. Nothing more."*

*"Yes sir."* The words tasted bitter on Varian's tongue. **Grukmar territory**. The thought made his skin crawl. How many times had he stared into those trees, wondering? The dark canopy hid a thousand nightmares.

## Preparations

They emerged into the pale morning, steps heavy. Elric blew out a breath.

*"Blood and ashes. I never thought..."* He trailed off.

*"I know."* Varian's hand found his sword hilt again, an unconscious habit. The weight was reassuring.

They walked the outpost perimeter in grim silence, checking the crude palisade for weaknesses. It seemed a flimsy barrier against the vastness of the forest. Varian's eyes kept flicking to those brooding trees, searching the shadows between the trunks.

By midmorning, they had a dozen men assembled, bleary-eyed villagers clutching makeshift spears and axes. Some looked scarcely older than boys.

Varian surveyed them, mouth dry. *"Right. You all know why you're here."* Blank faces stared back. He swallowed. *"There's been trouble on the frontier. Attacks. The captain needs extra hands to patrol our borders."*

Mutters rippled through the group. Varian raised his voice. *"We'll be working in shifts. Four-hour rotations. You'll have a seasoned guard with you at all times. Keep your eyes sharp and your wits about you."*

He met each man's gaze in turn, trying to project a confidence he didn't feel. *"Any questions?"*

Silence. He nodded curtly. *"Good. Elric will assign your posts."*

He strode away before his facade could crack, Elric's murmured instructions fading behind him. The sun climbed as he walked the village bounds, a cold eye peering through scudding clouds.

## The Watch

By the time he returned to the outpost, the new patrols had been dispatched and an uneasy calm settled. He found Elric in the armory, methodically sharpening his blade.

*"All quiet?"* Varian asked.

*"So far. You?*

*"The same. It feels wrong. Like the calm before a storm."*

Elric tested his sword edge against a thumb. *"Captain's orders were clear. We watch and wait."*

*"I mislike this waiting,"* Varian growled. *"If there are goblins out there..."*

*"What? You want to go hunting? In Grukmar?"* Elric shook his head. *"You heard the captain. We don't cross that line."*

*"And if they cross it first?"*

Elric met his gaze. In his eyes, Varian saw his own frustration mirrored. *"Then we'll be ready."*

They took first watch together, walking the palisade as the sun sank in a blaze of red and gold. The forest crouched in eerie stillness, not even a breath of wind in the leaves. They patrolled in terse silence, senses straining. Every snapping twig made hands leap to hilts.

As dusk thickened, they lit torches, the flames hissing and popping. Varian peered into the gathering dark, imagining eyes looking back. Hungry eyes, biding their time.

Elric paused, torch casting flickering shadows over his angular face. *"Do you believe the stories? About the Goblin rituals?"*

Varian shrugged. *"Fireside tales. Meant to scare children into obedience."*

*"The captain takes them seriously."*

*"He has to. It's his job."*

*"But you don't?"*

Varian looked out at the trees, their trunks bone-pale in the fading light. *"I believe something evil lives in that forest. Maybe the Grukmari find it. Maybe it finds them. Either way, only a fool would seek it out."*

Elric grunted, then froze. *"There! Did you see that?"* He pointed with his torch.

Varian squinted. The torch cast a feeble pool of light, barely piercing the shadowed undergrowth. Darkness pressed close, thick and fluid.

*"I don't - wait."* A flicker of movement, there and gone. Varian drew his sword. The rasp of steel sounded overloud.

They stood poised, barely breathing. The night hung in perfect stillness, expectant. A branch cracked, echoing like a thunderclap. Varian whirled, heart hammering.

A shape burst from the trees, bounding toward the palisade. Elric shouted, lunging. His torch swept down -

And a frightened hare scampered between the posts, bolting for cover.

Elric sagged, laughing shakily. *"Looks like we've found our goblin."*

Varian didn't smile. He stared into the forest, the night breeze clammy on his face. Branches creaked and settled like old bones. Leaves hissed, sibilant whispers in a forgotten tongue. The dark spaces between the trees gaped like maws.

Slowly, he sheathed his sword and turned away.

They completed their circuit in a watchful hush and shambled back to the barracks, stiff with cold and fatigue. The outpost lay silent save for the crackle of cookfires and the occasional murmur of voices.

Elric paused outside the long, low building. *"Varian. The things we heard as boys..."*

*"I know."* He laid a hand on Elric's shoulder. *"Get some rest. Tomorrow will bring what it brings."*

But rest proved elusive. Varian tossed on his narrow pallet, mind racing. He saw again the girl's ravaged face, the ancient trees cloaked in shadow, their branches grasping. When sleep finally came, it was filled with hulking shapes and glinting eyes and the copper stench of blood.

## Signs of the Enemy

Dawn broke grey and sullen. Varian rose bleary-eyed, limbs aching. He forced down a bowl of thin gruel and stumbled out to the yard. Elric was waiting, face drawn. He looked as if he'd slept as poorly as Varian.

*"Patrol's back,"* he said tersely. *"They found something."*

Varian's stomach clenched. *"Show me."*

They strode through the outpost gate, Elric in the lead. A handful of men clustered near the tree line, voices low and tense. They parted as Varian approached.

Gouged into the damp earth were tracks, long and splayed. Inhuman. Elric crouched, tracing one with a finger.

*"Goblin?"* Varian asked, though he already knew the answer.

Elric nodded grimly. *"Found them ranging half a mile along the border. Looks like a scouting party."*

Cold dread settled in Varian's gut. He stared into the forest, the trees taking on a sinister cast. **Goblin scouts, testing their defenses. Probing for weakness.** It could only mean one thing.

*"They're coming,"* he murmured. *"Blood of the ancestors, they're finally coming."*

Elric rose, face hardening into a mask. *"Then we'd best be ready to meet them."* He turned to the gathered men. *"Back to your posts. Sharpen your steel and keep your eyes peeled. Those goblins won't catch us unaware."*

The men dispersed, muttering. Varian lingered, gaze fixed on the dark spaces between the trees. The forest seemed to mock him, secretive and watchful.

How long? How long had they lurked there, biding their time? What horrors did those shadows conceal?  He thought of the settlers hacking their farmsteads from the wilderness, sowing crops within sight of that malevolent treeline. Foolhardy courage, or blind ignorance?

> *"Old gods preserve us,"* he breathed. *"I fear evil stirs in Grukmar."*

He felt Elric's hand on his shoulder, the grip tight. *"Then it's our task to stop it. Whatever crawls out of those trees, we'll be the shield against it."*

They walked back through the outpost gate, footfalls heavy. Around them, men went about their work with furtive urgency, as if the very air hung in hushed anticipation. Above, the sky churned, slate-grey.
