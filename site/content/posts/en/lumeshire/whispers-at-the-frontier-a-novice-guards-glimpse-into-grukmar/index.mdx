## The Quiet Village

Varian slouched against the watchtower's rough-hewn post, eyes scanning the village below. It squatted in the shadow of the Grukmar forest, thatch-roofed huts clustered together as if for protection. Mist drifted through the muddy lanes and coiled around the scraggly pines at the wood's edge.

Beside him, Elric shifted and the planks creaked under his boots. The watch fire's restless light played across his face, throwing the hollows of his cheeks into sharp relief. He looked worn down, like a bowstring frayed from too much use.
*"Does it seem **too quiet** to you?"* Elric rubbed his hands over the small fire, fingers stiff with cold.

*"It's **always quiet**."* Varian stared out at the wall of dark trunks. *"That's the problem with this posting. **Nothing ever happens**."*

*"I'd rather have tedium than terror."*

*"You sound like my sister. She cried for a week when I got conscripted."* 

*"There are worse places to be stationed than a Lumean frontier village. I hear in [Frostgard](https://www.drusniel.com/ice-and-iron-the-unyielding-warriors-of-the-empire-of-frostgard/) they're fighting the giant hordes in the mountain passes."*

*"**Anything's better than guarding dirt farmers from imaginary monsters**."*

## Tales of Goblins

Elric leaned forward, eyes glinting. *"Who says they're imaginary? You've heard the **same stories** I have."*

Varian snorted. *"**Old wives' tales** to scare children into staying indoors at night."*

*"Then why won't the outpost commander let us patrol beyond the forest edge? What's he afraid we'll find?"* 

*"His own shadow, probably."*

*"Laugh all you want."* Elric's voice dropped low. *"But my uncle fought in the Grukmar campaigns. He told me things. **Things the Empire doesn't want us to know**."*

Varian raised an eyebrow. *"Such as?"*

Elric glanced over his shoulder before continuing in a hushed tone. *"The Grukmari worship **demon gods**. They **sacrifice captives** and **drink their blood** to gain **unholy strength**."*

*"Now you're just trying to scare me."*

*"Ever wonder why the Empire pulled back and left this whole region abandoned? They'd rather let the savages have it than risk **waking something ancient and evil** in those woods."*

Varian picked up a stick and prodded the coals. Sparks swirled up into the chill air. He thought uncomfortably of the stories he'd heard as a child. Fireside tales of **gore-splattered altars** and **gibbering things** that hunted unwary travelers by moonlight. **Superstitious nonsense** to entertain gullible peasants. And yet...

He shook himself, angry at his own morbid imaginings. Elric was watching him intently. 

*"You've let this backwater posting addle your brains."* Varian flung the stick into the fire. *"There's nothing out there but **sticks and squirrels**."*

## A Scream in the Night

Elric started to retort but cut off abruptly as a **shrill scream** echoed from the village below. They exchanged a startled glance.

*"That came from the square!"*

They snatched up their spears and clattered down the rickety tower steps, armor plates clanking. The village was still and dark, windows shuttered, wisps of smoke curling from the chimneys. The scream had cut off as suddenly as it started.

*"There!"* Elric pointed.

A figure stumbled out from between two huts and staggered into the open, arms flailing. It was a girl, perhaps twelve or thirteen, her homespun dress **ripped and muddied**.

Varian and Elric sprinted across the square and crouched beside her. 

*"What happened? Are you hurt?"*

The girl lifted a tear-streaked face, eyes wide with **terror**. She opened her mouth but no sound came out. She clutched at Varian's arm with **desperate strength**.

*"You're safe now,"* he said awkwardly. *"Let's get you home."*

He started to help her to her feet but she clung to him, refusing to budge. She stared fixedly at the narrow alley from which she'd emerged, **shaking like a leaf**.

Elric exchanged an uneasy glance with Varian. Slowly, they turned to peer into the shadows that crowded close between the leaning walls. Wind sighed through gaps in the thatch. Pools of darkness gathered in recessed doorways. **Anything could be hiding there, watching**. 

**Waiting**.

The girl whimpered. Varian's hand tightened on his spear haft. The night seemed to press in around them, alive with **subtle menace**. He remembered Elric's words and suppressed a shiver. **Sticks and squirrels**. Then why did the short hairs prickle on the back of his neck?
