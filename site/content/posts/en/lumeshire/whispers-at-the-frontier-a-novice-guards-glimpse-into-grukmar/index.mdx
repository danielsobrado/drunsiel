The watchtower groaned, a weary sentinel in the gloom. Varian leaned against a rough-hewn post, calloused hands testimony to years of martial service. His eyes, sharp despite the darkness, scanned the village below. Thatched huts huddled together beneath Grukmar forest's looming shadow, like children seeking a mother's skirts. Mist slithered through muddy paths, curling around thin pines at the wood's edge. To Varian, it looked like ghostly fingers, grasping at the village's fringes. Always reaching, never quite touching.

Elric shifted. Planks protested beneath his boots. Firelight danced across his face, deepening the lines etched by time and duty. In the flickering shadows, Varian saw not just his fellow guardsman, but a mirror of his own doubts and fatigue.

"Quiet," Elric murmured, hands outstretched to the meager flames.

Varian grunted. "Always is." The words carried the weight of countless nights just like this one. Another eve of vigilance in this gods-forsaken outpost, guarding against threats that never materialized. The familiar knot of frustration tightened in his gut.

"Could be worse." Elric's voice cut through Varian's brooding. "Heard they're battling giant hordes in the Frostgard passes."

"Better than guarding turnip farmers from their own shadows." Varian's words dripped with bitter sarcasm, a shield against the gnawing doubt he'd never admit to.

Elric leaned forward, eyes glinting with an intensity that made Varian uneasy. "Who says that's all we're guarding against?"

A snort escaped Varian, more bravado than belief. "Village gossip and nursery rhymes." But a chill whispered down his spine, unbidden and unwelcome.

"Then why keep us penned in?" Elric pressed, voice low and urgent. "What's the commander afraid we'll find?"

"His own incompetence, most like." Varian's deflection felt hollow, even to himself. He'd seen the fear in the commander's eyes, heard the tremor in his voice when he issued orders to never venture beyond the tree line.

Elric's voice dropped to a whisper, charged with dark promise. "My uncle served in the Grukmar campaigns. Told me things. Things they don't want known."

Varian raised an eyebrow, curiosity warring with the instinct for self-preservation. "Such as?"

A furtive glance over the shoulder, as if the very night might be listening. Elric's next words tumbled out in a rush. "The Grukmari worship old gods. Use captives for rituals. Gives them unnatural strength."

"You're full of shit." Varian's denial was automatic, a reflex against truths too terrible to contemplate. But doubt, insidious as the mist below, crept into his mind.

"Ever wonder why the Empire pulled back? Left all this land empty?"

Varian jabbed at the coals, sparks swirling upward like fleeing spirits. Childhood memories surfaced unbidden. Fireside whispers of blood-soaked altars and chittering horrors that hunted in moonlight. He shook his head, disgusted at his own foolishness. He was a soldier of the Empire, not some wide-eyed village boy jumping at shadows.

"You've let this backwater rot your brain," he growled, anger masking his unease. "Nothing out there butâ€”"

A scream shattered the night, high and terrible. Both men froze, eyes locking. Varian's heart hammered against his ribs, each beat screaming danger.

"The square!" Elric's voice cracked, fear stripping away years of practiced stoicism.

They sprang into action, muscle memory overriding terror. Boots pounded rickety steps as they descended. Armor plates clanked, the sound unnaturally loud in the silent village. Varian's eyes darted from shadow to shadow, every dark corner suddenly pregnant with menace. The village lay still, windows shuttered against the night. Only wisps of chimney smoke betrayed life within, spectral tendrils reaching for a sky devoid of stars.

"There!" Elric's shout cut through the fog of Varian's racing thoughts.

A small figure lurched from between two huts. A girl, no more than twelve, her dress a tattered flag of surrender. She stumbled into the open, arms flailing as if fighting off invisible assailants.

Varian's training took over. He sprinted forward, dropping into a crouch beside her. The smell of fear rolled off her in waves, acrid and primal. "Are you hurt?" The words came out gentler than he expected, surprising himself.

Her face lifted, a mask of terror etched in tear-tracks and grime. Her mouth worked soundlessly, eyes wide and unseeing. Fingers dug into Varian's arm with desperate strength, nails biting through the fabric of his sleeve. He felt her trembling, saw the raw horror in her eyes. It shook him to his core, this tangible evidence of nightmares made flesh.

"You're safe," he said, trying to project a confidence he didn't feel. The lie tasted bitter on his tongue. "Let's get you home."

She clung tighter, refusing to move. Her gaze fixed on the alley mouth, body shaking uncontrollably. Varian followed her stare, dread pooling in his stomach like ice water.

Elric and Varian exchanged a look, years of shared duty conveying volumes. Slowly, they turned toward the shadows crowding between leaning walls. Wind whispered through thatch, carrying hints of words just beyond understanding. Doorways gaped, black and hungry maws eager to devour the unwary.

The girl whimpered, a sound so small and broken it cut deeper than any battle cry. Varian's grip tightened on his spear, knuckles white beneath his gloves. The night pressed close, heavy with unseen threat. Every sense screamed danger, every instinct honed by years of service shrieking warnings he couldn't ignore.

Nothing out there but trees and squirrels, Varian told himself. The lie tasted bitter, ash and fear on his tongue.
