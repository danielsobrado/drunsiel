## Lumeshirean Divine Empire

A vast realm divided into many provinces, populated by humans, warriors, and paladins. They have limited contact with the dwarves, mainly for trade purposes. Lumeshireans battle with Grukmar tribes to the south and the Norths to the north. The empire is entangled in a web of political machinations, alliances, and betrayals with the Contian Theocracy.

Despite the constant threats from their neighbors, the Lumeshireans remain a proud and resilient people, united under the banner of their Divine Emperor.

The Contian Theocracy is a mysterious and enigmatic nation, where the lines between magic and religion are blurred. The mages of Contia are known for their mastery of the arcane arts, and their libraries are said to hold secrets that could reshape the very fabric of reality. Despite their supposed neutrality, the Contians are not above using their knowledge and power to further their own agendas.

## Empire of Frostgard

Home to the Norths, a race of barbarian warriors who wield runic magic and commune with spirits. Druids also play a significant role in their society. The northern reaches of Frostgard are plagued by giants, posing a constant threat to the Norths.

The people of Frostgard are as harsh and unforgiving as the frozen wastelands they inhabit. The Norths are a fiercely independent people, bound by ancient traditions and a deep connection to the spirits of the land. Their runic magic is a powerful tool in their arsenal, allowing them to harness the primal forces of nature and bend them to their will.

## Mountain Kingdom of Stonehold

A stronghold of dwarves and gnomes, perpetually defending against the incursions of the Grukmar tribes.

The Mountain Kingdom of Stonehold is a bastion of stability and strength in a world beset by chaos and conflict. The dwarves and gnomes who call this land home are master craftsmen and engineers, renowned for their skill in forging weapons and constructing impregnable fortresses. Their unyielding determination and fierce loyalty to one another have allowed them to weather countless storms and emerge stronger than ever.

## Kingdom of Elenoria

The realm of the elves.

Elenoria is a land of breathtaking beauty and ancient magic, where the very trees seem to whisper with the wisdom of ages past. The elves who dwell here are a graceful and enigmatic people, known for their mastery of the bow and their deep connection to the natural world. Despite their love of peace and harmony, the elves are fierce defenders of their homeland and will stop at nothing to protect it from those who would seek to do it harm.

## Grukmar Tribes

A chaotic and anarchic collection of orcs, goblins, and other repulsive creatures.

The Grukmar Tribes are a constant thorn in the side of the other nations of Astalor, their raids and incursions a never-ending source of terror and destruction. These savage and brutal creatures live only for the thrill of battle and the spoils of war, their societies ruled by the law of the strongest. Despite their lack of sophistication and organization, the Grukmar are a force to be reckoned with, their sheer numbers and relentless savagery making them a threat that cannot be ignored.

## Umbra'kor Dominion

The domain of the dark elves, serving as a buffer between the other lands and the Wymreach Dominion. They harness sinister powers to maintain their distance but often venture into Wymreach, hoping to gain favor.

## Wymreach Dominion

A prison for pure evil, separated from the rest of Astalor by a treacherous and tempestuous sea. Only the dark elves of Umbra'kor can establish contact with this forsaken realm.

> "Only the dark elves of Umbra'kor can establish contact with this forsaken realm."

The dark elves of Umbra'kor are a twisted reflection of their surface-dwelling cousins, their hearts and souls corrupted by the malevolent energies that seep from the Wymreach Dominion. They are a people defined by their ambition and their willingness to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals, no matter the cost. Despite their reputation as a necessary evil, the other nations of Astalor are wary of the Umbra'kor, knowing that their loyalties are as shifting and unpredictable as the shadows they call home.

The Wymreach Dominion is a land shrouded in mystery and dread, its very existence a blight upon the world of Astalor. The horrors that dwell within its borders are the stuff of nightmares, twisted abominations and malevolent entities that hunger for the souls of the living. The dark elves of Umbra'kor are the only ones who dare to venture into this accursed realm, their hearts hardened by the evil they have embraced and their minds twisted by the whispers of the dark powers they serve.
