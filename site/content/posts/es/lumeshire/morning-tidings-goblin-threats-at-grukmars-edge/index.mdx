As the morning sun cast a gentle glow over the sleepy village, the peaceful chirping of birds was abruptly shattered by hurried footsteps echoing through the quaint cobbled streets. Varian and Elric, still nursing the morning’s first brew, were jolted from their quiet contemplation. Their comrade, Alden, burst into the quaint guardhouse, his face pale and his breaths heavy with urgency.

“Oi, you blokes won’t believe what’s stirred up at dawn. Them goblins, they raided the border farms last night, nicked a bunch o’ cattle they did,” Alden blurted out, beads of sweat trickling down his brow.

“Goblins? Here? You’re pullin’ our leg,” Varian stuttered, his eyes widening as the weight of the news sunk in.

“No mate, wish I was. Farmer Giles was all in a tizzy, came rushin' for aid, said the goblins were like shadows snatchin’ away his livelihood,” Alden continued, his voice trembling slightly.

The room suddenly felt smaller, the walls seemingly closing in on them as the reality of what lay ahead dawned upon the young guards. The tales of Grukmar’s sinister tribes were no longer just fireside stories; they were a haunting reality lurking at the border.

Elric, gulping down the remnants of his brew, broke the silence, “We...we gotta tell the captain, ain’t we? This is serious business.”

“Right, right,” Varian stuttered, his hands fumbling to strap on his armor, each clink of metal a stark reminder of the danger that lay ahead.

They hurriedly made their way to the commanding officer's quarters, the streets that once felt welcoming now seemed to echo with whispers of the unknown. The camaraderie among them felt different - it was bound by a shiver of fear and the unyielding call of duty.

As they neared the captain’s quarters, the chatter between them grew frantic, “What if the goblins come again tonight? Do you reckon we’re ready for ‘em?”

“Ready or not, that’s what we’re here for, ain’t it? To guard these lands,” Varian muttered, trying to mask the quiver in his voice.

The stern face of their captain awaited them, ready to delve into the harrowing tales from the edge of Grukmar, as Varian and Elric steeled themselves to recount the grim news, their hearts pounding against the silvery crest of the Divine Empire emblazoned on their chests.
